		ALl of this are  a part of Web Revolution 

		So what is Web Revolution (2014 onwards and got coind in 2016)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


		1. When was the first time you used internet - Year ? -- World Average is 2005
		2. Where did u use internet in those days - Home - Office - Cyber 
		3. Why did you use internet for - Email, general social media, surfing
		4. Source of Internet - Broadband - WiFi- Dongle
		5. Devise - Laptop - Desktop 
		Thus web developer has to develop site accordingly
----------------------------
		Today
		1. Where do u use internet this days --- Everywhere
		2. Why did you use internet for --- Everything
		3. Source of Internet - Mobile Data + Wifi
		4. Devise - Mobile - devises - laptop 
			Mobile 
				Resolution is different for most of the mobile
				Habbits of end user
					images - zoom in zoom out with fingures
					video - flip the screen 
					Places - use Navigator - check in - check out
					We make internet run behind us 
					Clear the Caching
					Hardware is different
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------				
	We need to create an application which will work like an app installed on users 		machine

			Client Centeric App (REST calls, Routing, SPA application)
		--ASP.net, Java, PHP, Python, etc...this were server centeric apps
		--HTML, CSS and JS - they had their own drawback
			JS - was not at all OOPS based, not compiled

			W3C and ECMA - came out with OOPS version of JS, which is also compiled		
			ES6 has classes, methods, interfaces, datatypes etc....

			Problem - very difficult to program/script as syntax was totally differnt

			Thus Microsoft  - tool ES6 - made it easy look like C# and Java, gave a 				compiler - TypeScript

			Google - used Typescript and created client centeric framework for developer
				Angular
			Facebook - used Typescript and created client centeric framework for developer
				React
			Twitter - used Typescript and created client centeric framework for developer
				Bootstrap
			Opensouce - Backbone, knockout, 50+ testing framework 
			
			Google - Angular Material 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

			Angular Development 
				Softwares
					NodeJS
					VSCode - free tool for development
			

			Angular Developement 
				Components - Most of the development here
				Pipes - for data Format
				Services - API calls
					   Logic shareing
					   Routing
				Directives - short hand UI display
